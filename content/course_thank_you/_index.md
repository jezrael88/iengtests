Dear Student,

Thank you for sending us your application!

We will review your application and send you your Confirmation of Enrolment shortly. 
Remember that we are here to support you every step of the way. For those of you returning to iEngtests, we are glad to have you back as you continue your journey to the success stage. For those new students who are just joining our community, we encourage you to make the most of your time here. Your test preparation experience will be what you make it, and your opportunities will only be limited by the limits you place on yourself.

As you start a new learning experience, take advantage of the many services available to help you achieve your full potential. iEngtests offers many programmes to keep you on the road to success. Our iEngtests Support Centre is available 24/7 to help. 
I encourage you to join the Facebook Private Groups to help you develop more of your English skills throughout the year. During the year, you can also join me for a Chat and Zoom session â€“ an opportunity for me to learn more about you, your plans for your future, and to answer your questions.

Supporting you is central to our mission at iEngtests. We are here to guide you as you become the best version of yourself.

Remember to make it a great year. I will see you soon.

Welcome to iEngtests!

Roland Adala  
Director
