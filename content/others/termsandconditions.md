### COURSE ENROLMENT

As a student, when you enrol in a course, whether it’s a free or paid course, you are getting review materials from us. However, this does not give you any right to resell, reproduce, rent the material, duplicate, or redistribute content from iENGTESTS.  

We generally give ‘Unlimited’ preparation courses for our students. However, when a student has decided to book and take the exam, without finishing his/her course validity, iENGTESTS may decide to no longer provide teaching assistance, speaking assessments, writing assessments or Q&A services in association with a course. On the other hand, if a student is enroled in an ‘Until You Pass’ course, and has taken the exam but unsuccessful, he/she may still continue the course and receive our services, without paying any extra cost. 

Students may upgrade their course within 30 days from the time of their review (not on the enrolment date). After 30 days from the review date, no course package upgrade shall be granted. 

### REFUND POLICY

iENGTESTS offers a 100% no-questions-asked refund policy given that:

- You have NOT participated in any writing challenge
- You have NOT consumed/received any of the course content including but not limited to:
- Watching any of the course videos (partially or fully)

Our refund window is only made to help you gain confidence that we do have course content, we do have practice tests, we do have a Facebook group and all of the other services we advertised on our website. Once you have commenced the course and/or received our review materials, this would make you ineligible for a refund.

### NON REFUNDABLE FEES

No refund is available to students where:

- A student has already commenced the course and received the review materials; the full cost of the course is applicable. 
- The reservation fee of 20% is non-refundable except in the event that iENGTESTS is unable to run the course.

What constitutes “trying your best” is fully up to iENGTESTS’ discretion

### REFUNDS UPON WITHDRAWAL BY STUDENT
